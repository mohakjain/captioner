1. upload image 2. optionally crop it 3. add and position a caption 4. export it as a PNG or instagram story.

## Guidelines:

## Captions:
- Light yellow color
- Arial Italic font
- Black outline
- positioned on the bottom third of the image
- some drop shadow

## Crop image:
- Images should be croppable

## more customization options

- non italics
- add another caption
- position caption(s) wherever on the image.
